<!--
	This is a first draft (23 September 2016) of a skeleton XML file that would incorporate data from the database to produce XML export.
	Variables are wrapped in # marks.
	IN refers to the Inscriptions table record for the inscription we are exporting.
	OB refers to master object record linked to that inscription (as identified in #IN:Parent Object#).
	SUBOB refers to any subordinate objects for that object.
	If the database returns a blank for a given variable, then the XML wrappers for that variable should be suppressed, e.g. if #OB:width# is empty, then the whole <depth></depth> element should not appear.
	Where a numeric db field has a range instead of a single number, then these should be handled in the TEI approved way, e.g. using @min="value1" max="value2" in the respective elements.
	Where a numeric db field has a ~ (or ?) sign next to a number (this may occur in combination with a hyphenated range), it indicates that the value is approximate. This should also be handled according to TEI, probably using <precision>.

								<!-- My electronic editions generally follow printed editions, but there are only a very few that I have not compared with a facsimile and modified where I saw fit, so it isn't too cheeky to say I'm the editor of these texts so far. We might add here that the electronic edition has relied on the edition or editions listed in the bibliography. On the longer term we might want to include an Editors field in the inscriptions table, which would contain the names of people who have edited the inscription text (not other database content). Editor names or IDs could be separated by commas or an agreed-on separator, and here we could put #IN:Editors(1,2, ... n)# If we do this, it may be a good idea to distinguish original editor from subsequent editors, and to add a date field to each editor's work. And while we're at it, one more field for a brief description of the editing done would also be necessary. (The earlier epidoc template included an <encodingDesc> elment as the last item of the TEI header, but this is not present in the latest template, so I do not use it in this file. The person responsible for encoding is the original editor.) -->

But many of these will be dated, which is why I have included an "Authority" field so that we have a biblioreference for these data. In any case, it may be a good idea to divide up the database table to contain separate fields for settlement, repository and idno, even if these fields will only be filled for a few items. Where I now have "in situ" in the table, that will probably need to be changed to a settlement name and, possibly, some sort of geolocation information. -->

So maybe get rid of everything other than Details in History; or, as a midway solution, keep the Created date and Place fields which, if populated, may be useful if they can be used as search parameters. (But we have a separate date in the inscription table, and there's a reason for that: occasionally the object has a history before the inscription, perhaps involving earlier inscriptions than the one edited here. This may be another point in favour of discarding the structured history and just showing the dates elsewhere.) -->
